## 🎯 Best Practices

### Agent Selection Guidelines

- Complex workflows with dependencies
- Quality-critical deliverables
- Timeline-sensitive projects

### Communication Tips

**Be Specific**
```bash
# Good
@developer Add Stripe subscription billing with webhooks to my Next.js app using TypeScript

# Too vague  
@developer Add payments
```

**Provide Context**
```bash
@coordinator Build user dashboard for my SaaS:
Context: B2B project management tool, 50+ user companies
Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
Timeline: 1 week for MVP, 2 weeks for full features
Priority: Mobile-first design, fast loading
```

**Use Mission Templates**
```bash
# Instead of long descriptions, reference missions
@coordinator Use MISSION-BUILD to add real-time notifications
```
