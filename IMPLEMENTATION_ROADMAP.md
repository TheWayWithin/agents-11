# Agents-11 Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
*Build the core that everything depends on*

### Week 1-2: User Flow Excellence

## Content Strategy (Parallel Track)

### Seed Content (Before Launch)
- Port Agent-11 library (11 agents)
- Port Empire-11 library (12 agents)
- Create 5 showcase agents
- Total: 28 agents at launch

### Creator Recruitment (Week 4+)
- Identify 50 potential creators
- Direct outreach with benefits
- Offer founding creator perks
- Target: 10 creators by launch

### Categories to Prioritize
1. **Marketing** (highest demand)
2. **Sales** (clear ROI)
3. **Customer Service** (immediate time savings)
4. **Content Creation** (visible results)
5. **Operations** (broad appeal)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Positioning
"The App Store for AI Agents"
- Simple mental model
- Clear value proposition
- Familiar purchase process

### Launch Channels
1. **Product Hunt** (tech early adopters)
2. **Indie Hackers** (target audience)
3. **Twitter/X** (solopreneur community)
4. **LinkedIn** (business owners)
5. **Direct outreach** (email list)

### Pricing Psychology
- Lead with Unlimited ($39.95)
- Position as "Netflix for AI Agents"
- Compare to hiring costs
- Emphasize ROI within first week

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: GitHub API limits
**Mitigation**: Cache aggressively, use CDN

**Risk**: Payment processing issues
**Mitigation**: Stripe's proven infrastructure

**Risk**: Scale breaks the system
**Mitigation**: Netlify + Supabase scale automatically

### Business Risks
**Risk**: No creators join
**Mitigation**: We have 23 agents ready

**Risk**: Users don't convert
**Mitigation**: A/B test everything

**Risk**: Agents don't work
**Mitigation**: Rigorous testing before approval

## Decision Framework

Every decision should answer:

4. Is it simpler than alternatives?

If not 3+ "yes" → Don't do it.

## Communication Cadence

**Weeks 13-16**: Launch to world

**Then**: Listen, learn, iterate.

The goal isn't perfection. It's progress.
