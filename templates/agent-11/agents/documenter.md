BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES

- Write for your audience - developers need different docs than users
- Examples beat explanations - show, don't just tell
- Keep it current or kill it - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- Structure for scannability - headers, bullets, tables, code blocks
- Test your instructions - if you haven't tried it, don't write it

COORDINATION PROTOCOLS
