# Client Journey Specification
**Project:** Agents-11 AI Agent Marketplace  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Ready

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the complete client journey for the Agents-11 marketplace, designed to achieve 3-5% visitor-to-paid conversion through value-first positioning, guarantee-backed confidence, and friction-free implementation. No free trials or free tiers - only paid subscriptions with 30-day money-back guarantee.

### The Three-Tier Value Ladder

**TIER 1: UNLIMITED ($39/month)**
- Primary offer shown first
- Email → Payment → Validation → Full Access
- Expected: 40-50% take rate

**TIER 2: PACKAGES ($14.95-$24.95/month)**  
- Shown only if Unlimited declined
- Email → Payment → Validation → Package Access
- Expected: 30-40% take rate

**TIER 3: FREE BROWSE**
- Only if both paid options declined
- Email → Validation → Browse-Only Access
- Expected: 10-20% take rate (high conversion potential)

### Key Innovation: Email Gate
**Nobody sees the marketplace without providing a validated email.** This ensures:
- 100% email capture before browsing
- Ability to retarget all visitors
- Behavioral tracking for smart upsells
- No "window shopping" without commitment

### Key Experience Principles
- **Progressive Value Ladder:** Move users down tiers, not up
- **Email Gate:** Marketplace access requires validated email
- **Trust Throughout:** Guarantee mentioned 5+ times, Stripe security
- **Smart Upsells:** Contextual upgrade prompts based on user tier

## Core Principles

### Doug Hall Framework Implementation
- **Overt Benefit:** Get a $500K AI team working in 60 seconds for $39/month
- **Dramatically Different:** Complete AI employees on YOUR computer, not cloud chatbots
- **Real Reasons to Believe:** Created Agent-11 system, 30-day guarantee, live metrics

### Pricing Strategy
- **No Free Tier:** Quality positioning through paid-only access
- **Guarantee-Centered:** 30-day money-back guarantee replaces trial
- **Unlimited-First:** Primary offer is $39/month unlimited access
- **Fallback Options:** Browse marketplace only if declining unlimited

### Pricing Structure
- **Unlimited Access:** $39/month - All packages + individual agents + new releases
- **Package Pricing:** Themed bundles with 20-40% discount vs individual
- **Individual Agent:** Higher price when bought separately

### Package Examples
**Marketing Suite** ($19.95/month)
- THE MARKETER + THE COPYWRITER + THE DESIGNER + THE ANALYST
- Save $20 vs individual ($39.80 separately)

**Development Team** ($24.95/month)
- THE DEVELOPER + THE TESTER + THE ARCHITECT + THE DOCUMENTER + THE OPERATOR
- Save $25 vs individual ($49.75 separately)

**Business Operations** ($19.95/month)
- THE COORDINATOR + THE SUPPORT + THE ACCOUNTANT + THE ASSISTANT
- Save $20 vs individual ($39.80 separately)

**Solopreneur Starter** ($14.95/month)
- THE COORDINATOR + THE MARKETER + THE SUPPORT
- Save $15 vs individual ($29.85 separately)

### Individual Agent Pricing
- **Standalone agent:** $9.95/month (when not in package)
- **Add-on to package:** $4.95/month (50% discount)
- **Bundle multiple packages:** Additional 10% off total

### Smart Upsell Logic
- If selecting 2+ individual agents: "Get the [Package Name] and save $X"
- If cart total ≥ $30: Show banner "Get UNLIMITED for just $39"
- If buying 2+ packages: "Unlock everything with Unlimited and save"
- If package + 2 add-ons: "Upgrade to next tier for better value"

```

    agents: ["marketer", "copywriter", "designer", "analyst"],
    savings: 20.00,

];
```

### User States & Display Logic

#### State 1: Unlimited User ($39/month)
```
- All agents show "Download" button
- No upgrade prompts
- Success metrics displayed
- "You have unlimited access" banner
```

#### State 2: Package User (e.g., Marketing Suite)
```
- Package agents show "Download" button
- Other agents show "Unlock for $4.95/mo"
- Upgrade banner: "Get everything for just $19 more"
- Shows current package + available upgrades
```

#### State 3: Browse-Only User (Free)
```
- All agents show "Unlock" with price
- Persistent banner: "Get everything for $39/month"
- Behavioral tracking for smart prompts
- "You've viewed 5 agents" → upgrade trigger
```
