### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] MVP Development Complete
- [x] Visual UI Enhancement with 52 assets
- [x] Testing Framework Established
- [x] Netlify Configuration Created
- [x] GitHub Repository Created
- [x] Initial Git commit prepared

### In Progress 🔄

- [ ] Removing sensitive files from Git history
- [ ] Setting up Netlify deployment

### Blockers & Solutions 🚧

**Current Blocker**: GitHub Push Protection detected secrets in .env.mcp file
- **Issue**: API tokens (Figma, GitHub) in commit history
- **Solution**: Resetting Git history and removing secrets
- **Status**: Executing fix now

## 📈 Deployment Steps Completed

1. ✅ Git repository initialized
2. ✅ Initial commit created
3. ✅ GitHub repository connected
4. 🔄 Pushing to GitHub (fixing secrets issue)
5. ⏳ Netlify setup (next)
6. ⏳ DNS configuration (next)
7. ⏳ SSL certificate (next)
8. ⏳ Production launch (next)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Git & Secrets Management
- Always add .gitignore BEFORE first commit
- GitHub Push Protection is helpful but requires clean history
- Use git reset --soft to fix commit history while preserving files
- Environment files should never be committed

### Deployment Strategy
- Netlify chosen over Vercel for easier DNS management
- Custom domain: agents-11.com ready for configuration
- Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch configured

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. Reset Git history to remove secrets
2. Force push clean history to GitHub
3. Set up Netlify account
4. Configure custom domain
5. Add environment variables
6. Launch production site

## 📊 Time Investment

- MVP Development: 1 day
- Visual Enhancement: 4 hours
- Deployment Setup: 2 hours (in progress)
- Expected Total: 3 hours for complete deployment

## 🏆 Achievements

- Complete marketplace MVP built in record time
- Professional visual design system implemented
- 52 custom assets integrated successfully
- Production-ready codebase with testing
- Comprehensive deployment documentation created

## 📝 Notes for Future

- Create .gitignore template for new projects
